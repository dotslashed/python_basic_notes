Metacharacters are characters with a special meaning:
All meta characters: . ^ $ * + ? { } [ ] \ | ( )
Meta characters need need to be escaped (with ) if we actually want to search for the char.

    . Any character (except newline character) "he..o"
    ^ Starts with "^hello"
    $ Ends with "world$"
    * Zero or more occurrences "aix*"
    + One or more occurrences "aix+"
    { } Exactly the specified number of occurrences "al{2}"
    [] A set of characters "[a-m]"
    \ Signals a special sequence (can also be used to escape special characters) "\d"
    | Either or "falls|stays"
    ( ) Capture and group
